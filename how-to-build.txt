Gosh, using the labelling source code from CVS is as easy as 1, 2, 3!  4!


1. Install CYGWIN if it's not on your system already.
If you are installing it, install it to c:\cygwin, so that the paths
that are hardcoded there will still work.  I think there's only one,
the path to make.exe, but there might be more.

The cygwin website is www.cygwin.com.  When it asks you for a mirror
to choose, mirrors.kernel.org is a good one.  You really only need the
Base system and make.

2. Install MSys and MinGW.
MSys is a minimalist set of tools that can be used to build software.
It includes grep and the other text utilities, and a shell, and stuff.
MinGW is a port of GCC to windows that does not depend on Cygwin.

Install MinGW first, to c:\mingw (the default directory).
http://umn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mingw/MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe

Then, install MSys, to c:\msys (the default directory).
http://umn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/mingw/MSYS-1.0.10.exe 
Msys pops up a text-mode "post-install" script, which you want to run.
Tell it that Yes, you have MinGW installed, in "c:/mingw" (forward
slash!).

3. Install CDT (Eclipse's environment for C, C++).
If you're using Eclipse 3.1, go to Help->Software Updates->Find and
Install.  "Search for new features to install", Next, New Remote Site: 
http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/eclipse3.1

Then it will install once you "detect the features" there.

Install CDT itself, not the CDT development SDK thing.

Once that's all worked out,

4. "Create a New Project from CVS" from 
edam-enchilada.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/edam-enchilada .  
The module name is label.

OK, so it's all ready to compile!  Except maybe not, so keep reading.

If you installed cygwin in a different place from me, you might have
to change the "Build command", in the C/C++ Make Project pane of the
project's Preferences.  If you have to do this, we might want to add
.cdtproject, the file that stores settings like this, to .cvsignore.

Once you've easily compiled spectrum.exe, you can tell whether it
depends on CYGWIN by running this command in a cygwin/msys terminal 
(in the correct directory):
objdump -p spectrum.exe | grep "DLL Name"
It should only list KERNEL32.DLL and msvcrt.dll (Microsoft's C runtime
library, distributed with Windows).


A much smaller problem: If *eclipse* (rather than make) complains to
you about not being able to find include files (lots of yellow
underlines on every include statement of a c++ header, for example),
then you'll need to tell it where to find c++ headers.  They live in
the cygwin install directory/lib/gcc/i686-pc-cygwin/3.4.4/include/c++
on my system.  you tell eclipse about these directories by
right-clicking on the project and selecting properties, then selecting
c/c++ include paths and symbols in the left pane.
